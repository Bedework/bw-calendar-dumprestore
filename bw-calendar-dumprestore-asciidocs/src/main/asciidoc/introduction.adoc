[[dumprestore]]
== Dumprestore
Dump/restore code for bedework. Produces or consumes an external representation of the data.

Note that this version is flagged for a vulnerability in digester3 -> commons-beanutils.

The installed beanutils does not have a vulnerability but it might prevent this code from working. Digester3 is used for restore from the XML dump. We are currently migrating away from that.
